'''Question 1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? 
Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance.
 The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand 
 your logic.'''

'''Answer: By default, Django signals execute synchronously. This means that when a 
signal is sent, the connected receivers are executed one by one in the same order in 
which they were connected, and the signal sender waits for all receivers to finish 
before continuing execution.

Hereâ€™s a code snippet that demonstrates this behavior:'''


from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received for:", instance.name)

# Creating an instance of MyModel
obj = MyModel.objects.create(name="Test")
print("Object created")  # This will be printed after the signal handler completes

'''In the above code, we define a Django model MyModel and a signal handler function 
my_signal_handler that is connected to the post_save signal of MyModel. When an instance 
of MyModel is created (obj = MyModel.objects.create(name="Test")), the signal is sent and
the signal handler is executed synchronously. The print statement "Object created" will  
only execute after the object has been created and the signal handler has complete'''
